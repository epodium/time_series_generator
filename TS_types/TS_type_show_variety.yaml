class_name: "Show variety"
description: > 
    This file defines a test type for time series generation.
    It contains a wide variety of different signals and shapes.
    It also applies random walk and gaussian noise.

# Define rules for generating shape(s).
shape_description: >
    Cosine wave is added to two channels.
    One cosine for channel 9 and three interfering cosines for channel 10. 
    Channel 9 is in addition dempened by an exponential.
