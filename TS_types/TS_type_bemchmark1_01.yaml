class_name: "Benchmark1 type 1"
description: > 
    Part of a synthetic benchmarking dataset to evaluate classifiers.
    Aim is to test different aspects of time series.
    Benchmark1 is about same channel type signals (e.g. EEG, arrays of vibrational
    sensors or similar).

signal_description: >
    Three peaks in the first four channels.
    With some variation in in width and position.
    But all three peaks will be at (nearly) the same time positions.
